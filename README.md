# IllegalArgumentException in Scala Class Setter

This example showcases a common error in Scala: improper handling of potential exceptions during object creation or modification.

The `MyClass` demonstrates a simple class with a name and age. The setter method for age performs input validation; however, attempting to set an invalid value results in an `IllegalArgumentException`.

The solution demonstrates how to handle this exception gracefully.
